Steps we took to build.

1. Start project: Create the app in the current directory. ```npx create-react-app .```
2. Make sure the program can run. ```npm start```
3. Build the app to create the static assets for the project. ```npm run build```
4. Install packages for the server. ```npm i express morgan serve-favicon```
